    The scheme of expression evaluation is called the substitution model.
    The idea underlying this model is that all evaluation does is reduce an expression to a value.
    It can be applied to all expressions, as long as they have no side effects.

    The substitution model is formalized in the Î»-calculus, which gives a foundation for functional programming.

  /*
   EVALUATION STRATEGIES
   There are two: call-by-value and call-by-name.

    Both strategies reduce to the same final values as long as
    the reduced expression consists of pure functions, and both evaluations terminate.
    - Call-by-value has the advantage that it evaluates every function argument only once.

    - Call-by-name has the advantage that a function argument is not evaluated if the corresponding parameter
    is unused in the evaluation of the function body.

    Scala normally uses call-by-value.
