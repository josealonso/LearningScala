  In Scala assignment always results in the unit value.
  And "operators" in Scala are just methods.
  = is the only real operator of the language. But it is context dependant.
  The language is a lot more consistent and simpler when you don't have mutability.
  In Scala you can declare (without assigning anything) variables only in abstract classes and traits. So you have almost always definitions.

  Almost everything is an expression and has a type. Even definitions.
  var a has a type (String). The expression var a = "test" also has a type: Unit
  Most expressions don't have the type Unit. Unit is a signal that the expression was only a side-effect
  (eg. variable assignment). But most Scala code involves building up expressions of more interesting types.

  // Afterwards, the name refers to the value.
  /*
    The scheme of expression evaluation is called the substitution model.
    The idea underlying this model is that all evaluation does is reduce an expression to a value.
    It can be applied to all expressions, as long as they have no side effects.

    The substitution model is formalized in the Î»-calculus, which gives a foundation for functional programming.

  /*
   EVALUATION STRATEGIES
   There are two: call-by-value and call-by-name.

    Both strategies reduce to the same final values as long as
    the reduced expression consists of pure functions, and both evaluations terminate.
    - Call-by-value has the advantage that it evaluates every function argument only once.

    - Call-by-name has the advantage that a function argument is not evaluated if the corresponding parameter
    is unused in the evaluation of the function body.

    Scala normally uses call-by-value.
